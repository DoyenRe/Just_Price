# Just Price

This is my first Python 'Game'. The idea was to create a copy of th Just Price game. 

## Game Mode
They are two game modes:
1) **Tentatives** : The user has a limited number of guess to discover the price of the item
2) **TimeOut** : The user has a limited number of time to discover the price of the item. 

###Notice
Notice that for now, no real price is used. The script is simply generating a random number at the start of the game.
