The **Price is Right** is a television game show. In the show, contestants compete to win cash & prizes by guessing the price of merchandise. 
This simple python game wants to copy the mecanics of the TV show. Indeed, in order to win, you'll have to guess a price randomly deciced by the script ! 
Good luck !

## The Game
They are two game modes:
1) **Tentatives** : The user has a limited number (10) of guess to discover the price of the item.
2) **TimeOut** (Work In Progress): The user has a limited number of time (60 seconds) to discover the price of the item. 

### Notice
Notice that for now, no real price is used. The script is simply generating a random number at the start of the game. 


## Content 
* /app.py - The actual Python app
* /images - Contains the images used in the app
* /mockup - Contains the original mockups of the project

## Remaining things to do 

The project is still in progress:
* The second 'TimeOut' mode still have to be developped. 
* Use a real price instead of a randomly generated number
* Make the code 'cleaner'
